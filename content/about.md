I work at ZOZO Technologies, Inc. as a research scientist in applied machine learning.
My interests are recommender systems, data science on fashion or e-commerce, and other related topics in machine learning.

During graduate school, I studied particle physics phenomenology. 
My particular interest was model-building of particle dark matter and its detection.
I also contributed to astrophysics investigating thermal evolution of neutron stars, which is  important for probing dark matter physics.

You can find my physics papers [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1284683?ui-citation-summary=true).

In my research, I experienced a lot of international collaborations, and numerical calculation/simulation. These are the foundation of my career in data science/machine learning.
